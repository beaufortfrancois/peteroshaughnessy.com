Earlier this year I wrote an article for [Disrupts Magazine](http://www.disrupts.co.uk/) on [“Solving Big Data for Humans”](http://pebblecode.com/blog/solving-big-data-for-humans/). 

It was originally inspired by [a post from Beau Cronin](https://medium.com/@beaucronin/the-oculus-rift-is-an-applied-neuroscience-powerhouse-512e3213f055) about how virtual worlds could help us to analyse complex data. It got me thinking about how we will need tools like Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality to help make sense of our increasingly complex world of data.  

It’s early days, but people are already starting to experiment with Virtual Reality data visualisation, for example [Wall Street Journal’s Nasdaq roller coaster ride](http://graphics.wsj.com/3d-nasdaq/).
