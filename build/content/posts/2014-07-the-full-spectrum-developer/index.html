<h1 id="-the-full-spectrum-developer-">&quot;The Full Spectrum Developer&quot;</h1>
<p>This week I was invited to attend a talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/mfeathers">Michael
Feathers</a> at the offices of News UK. The
topic was “The Full Spectrum Developer”.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from Laurence Gellert’s post <a href="http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/">“What is a Full <em>Stack</em>
Developer?”</a>,
Michael talked about how we should broaden our horizons. Don’t just
master one small domain; try to understand a bit about every aspect of
your industry, from business needs, to hosting, to user experience. That
way we can contribute intelligently and reduce the communication cost
between separate teams.</p>
<p>It was a thought-provoking talk, so I wanted to share my notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a wide span in skills across the industry. What motivates
people to go beyond?</li>
<li>Curiosity? What does it mean? How do you nurture it?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/">“The Full Stack
Developer”</a>
understands the whole stack, as well as the business</li>
<li>Silos don’t work well due to the communication cost</li>
<li>The socio-dynamics of different teams can make things go crazy -
“the designers don’t understand about development” - “the developers
don’t understand about design&quot;… We have to move away from that</li>
<li>Don’t get yourself caught in a silo</li>
<li>The Full Spectrum Developer knows about:<ul>
<li>Server, network, and hosting environment</li>
<li>Data modelling</li>
<li>Business logic</li>
<li>API layer / Action Layer / MVC</li>
<li>User Interface</li>
<li>User Experience</li>
<li>Customer and business needs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Know it all the way up and down the chain</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Thomas_(software_developer">David A.
Thomas</a>)
is a great example of a full stack developer - knows everything from
microprocessor coding to employee retention</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup">Bjarne Stroustrup</a>
built C++ for himself and became the father of a language</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp">Robert Fripp</a>
continuously reinvented himself</li>
<li>Be distracted sometimes</li>
<li>“I can see this barrier. Can I go around it? No, I’ll break through
it”</li>
<li>“Be the stupidest person in the room” - if you’re going to
transition to new things, get used to this</li>
<li>Start asking questions early on in the conversation</li>
<li>Never underestimate what you know - we all have things to contribute</li>
<li>“The people who do well are people who read” - reading is
fundamental</li>
<li>Cells were the inspiration for Object Oriented Programming</li>
<li>In SmallTalk, everything is an object, all the way down</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a>, creator of
SmallTalk, is great with metaphors - take a metaphor from one part
of the world and apply it to another</li>
<li>One that didn’t really take off is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_(programming_language">Lucid</a>),
“the dataflow programming language” - uses the metaphor of fluid
dynamics - powerful</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_programming_language">APL</a> is a
programming language that uses non-ASCII characters. Funky!</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_programming_language">J</a> is derived
from APL - Quicksort in one line!</li>
<li>Challenge yourself - cultivate 3 conceptual interests outside of
work</li>
<li>E.g. Functional programming - pick something outside of your
expertise</li>
<li>Push the edges - try it out</li>
<li>Different languages - build a repertoire</li>
<li>Recommended books:<ul>
<li><a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning">Pragmatic Thinking &amp; Learning, Refactor Your Wetware, Andy
Hunt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do">Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software
Craftsman, David H. Hoover &amp; Adewale
Oshineye</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn what you need to do your job well, but take distractions - be
curious</li>
<li>Time-box it - don’t think of it as a chore</li>
</ul>
