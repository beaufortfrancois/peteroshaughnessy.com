<p>What will the Web be like in 2020 (five years from now)? How will web
development have changed? Last week I gave a talk at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Emberjs-User-Group/events/218940841/">Ember
London</a> that
took a high level view of current technology trends and anticipated
advances, to see if we can predict some of the changes ahead.</p>
<p>I invite you to time travel with me, by checking out the talk below!</p>

<p><strong>Updates / Corrections</strong></p>
<p>At the risk of highlighting something I got embarrassingly wrong - the
bit on the number of versions of Internet Explorer was very out of date
already. I added it in at the last minute, but of course, <a href="http://www.geek.com/news/microsoft-decides-to-automatically-update-internet-explorer-for-everyone-1449517/">IE has
already moved to an auto-update model like the other
browsers</a>.
Plus, Microsoft are <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8230631/microsoft-is-killing-off-the-internet-explorer-brand">moving away from the Internet Explorer name
altogether</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll try to keep this post up to date with further corrections as and
when we know more about how the predictions pan out!</p>
<p>Please let me know in the comments if you spot anything else!</p>
<p><strong>Thanks</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to Jamie White and Ember London for hosting me, and to everyone
who responded to my survey and passed on their ideas.</p>
