It won’t simply be dictated to us by those who make web browsers. The Web is based on open standards that we can all contribute to. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, in the past, browsers have sometimes provided features that were too “magical”; they didn’t allow web developers enough control and they ended up being limiting and frustrating.

By the end of this year, developers will be able to start using a new feature called <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker_API\">Service Workers</a> which will give web apps lots of new powers to work offline (and more).

<p>And since the Web is open and extensible, we can all have our own say in
its future too.</p>
